1. "What is the shape of the images training set (how many and the dimension of each)?"
   * The shape of the training set is (60000, 28, 28). This means that the length of the image training set is 60,000 images, and each image is 28 x 28.
2. "What is the length of the labels training set?"
   * The length of the labels training set is also 60,000, coordinating with the length of the image training set. This means there is a label for each image.
3. "What is the shape of the images test set?"
   * The shape of the image test set is (10000, 28, 28). This means that there are 10,000 images with each image having a dimension of 28x28. There are less test than train images, but they have the same dimensions which is to be expected.
